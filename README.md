# State_of_Connecticut_Real_Estate_Sales

Hello, this repository houses the material I used to conduct an analysis of the Connecticut housing market. The Juptyer notebook file 'Connecticut_Housing_Sales_Data.ipynb' has the analysis itself. I have the original data split into 6 files to stay under GitHub's 25 MB limit, and I have GeoJson data used to make interactive folium maps.

This data is orginally from the State of Connecticut Office of Policy and Management, and was sourced from data.gov. The link to the data.gov landing page is as follows: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/real-estate-sales-2001-2018

GeoJson data used in mapping was sourced from https://deepmaps.ct.gov/datasets/CTDEEP::connecticut-and-vicinity-town-boundary-set/explore?layer=1&location=41.323050%2C-72.511382%2C9

The GeoJson data will have to be manually downloaded for the code to work as I was getting an error when trying to link to the GeoJson file via the Jupyter notebook. The original data files should be able to be accessed via the notebook just fine.
